#+TITLE: Houston

Houston is a Gemini server, written in Go. Primarily because I want to.
Not because it's necessary. There are plenty other Gemini servers that
have all important functionality covered, and several are written in Go
themselves. I just want to make my own.

That said, this aims to be lightweight and easy to use. I will be using
Houston to host my own capsule.

* Roadmap

  The only goal I currently have is to host static files in a sandboxed
  directory. Once I achieve that, I'll move on to some cool features.
